# My Dotfile
Im still working on it because it doesn't work in my iTerm so don't touch yet.

### What is was trying to change.
I wanted to make my Iterm more usable and orderly

*King*: i used a crown icon to show that i am ruler/admin on the pc

export PS1="ðŸ‘‘ \$(basename \$(pwd))"

* Alias for quicker movement trough the terminal 
  * alias desk='cd `/Desktop/
  * alias home='cd `/Documents/Sites/
  * alias c='clear'
  
### Iterm specific options
I changed a lot of preferences in my Iterm options like:
* Font-size from 10 - 11
* Font-family from Ariel to Raleway
* Opacity from totaly opaque to see true with a blur
    * This is handy you now can focus on the text behind your terminal aswell!
* I changed the standard start-up location from my /~ to my project map, for a quick start.

### How to install my Iterm profile
1. Download my iterm_profile.json
2. Go to your iterm preferences option
3. Go to GENERAL.
4. Look ad the bottom left there is a Load from custom url
5. Look for the just downloaded iterm_profile.json and select this.
6. Enjoy :^)
